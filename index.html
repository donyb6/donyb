            Over the past two weeks, I’ve been diving into FreeCodeCamp lessons, and it has been an incredible journey. I've learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, enabling me to create basic but functional web pages. While the lessons are straightforward, there were moments when I got stuck on specific tasks. With persistence and some research, I managed to overcome these challenges and gain confidence in my skills.

                <br />One of the highlights of my experience was seeing my projects come to life. Hosting my work online felt rewarding, as it gave me a tangible sense of achievement. Despite some frustrating issues, such as resetting lessons unnecessarily, I found that the platform’s structure helped me stay on track.

        <h2>MY PROGRESS</h2>
        <p>
            As I progressed, I noticed my understanding of web development concepts improving. I went from feeling unsure about tags and elements to confidently styling pages with CSS. There’s still much to learn, but these two weeks have laid a solid foundation for future growth.

            <br />The best part of this journey has been creating something from scratch and watching it evolve. Although the lessons sometimes felt repetitive, they reinforced my understanding. I now feel more prepared to tackle larger projects and expand my skills further.

        <p>
            Through consistent effort, I’ve gained confidence in my ability to solve problems independently. It’s been an exciting introduction to the world of web development.
